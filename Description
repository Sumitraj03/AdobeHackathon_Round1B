Persona-Driven Document Intelligence (Round 1B)
This project enhances a basic PDF outline extractor (Round 1A) into a persona-aware document analysis system. It processes multiple PDFs, understands a defined persona and objective (job-to-be-done), and generates ranked summaries of the most relevant sections and subsections. The system is optimized for offline execution with lightweight CPU performance and is fully Dockerized for cross-platform deployment.

Key Features
Extracts structured headings (H1â€“H3) and contextual snippets from PDFs.

Uses persona and job-to-be-done to rank document sections dynamically.

Generates a unified JSON report combining multiple PDFs.

Runs entirely offline; lightweight and fast (<1GB dependencies).

Fully containerized with Docker for consistent hackathon deployment.

Use Cases
Tailored literature reviews for researchers.

Persona-based document summarization for recruitment or legal analysis.

Pre-processing for semantic search or AI-powered insights.
